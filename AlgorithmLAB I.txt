Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or an odd number as well.
START
DECLARE INTEGER N and n is a number
IF N/n
	print "N is a divisor of n"
		IF N is divisor, CHECK N/2 = 0
			print " N is an even number"
		else
			print "N is an odd number"
ELSE
	print "N is not a divisor of n"
end

Implement an algorithm where the user enters a number, and an appropriate month is displayed.
START
Declare n is a number
IF n=1
	print" January "
   n=2
	print " February "
   n=3
	print " March "
   n=4
	print "April "
   n=5
	print" May "
   n=6
	print" June "
   n=7
	print" July "
   n=8
	print" August "
   n=9
	print" September "
   n=10
	print" October "
   n=11
	print" November "
   n=12
	print" December "
ELSE
	print " ERROR, Please enter a number<12 and >1 "
END

Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)
START
Declare 'n' as an integer
If n+n
	Display Sum of integers
Else
	Display " Enter Number"
If n-n
	Display the differencce between both integers
Else
	Display " Enter Number"
If n*n
	Display the product of both integers
Else
	Display " Enter Number"
If n/n
	Display the divison of both integers
Else
	Display " Enter Number"
